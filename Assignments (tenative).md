* [x] LC101 Code of Conduct

  > :warning: **CAUTION: Social Justice Drama!** 
  > While a Code of Conduct (CoC) is meant to keep the peace and to set the ground rules for what is acceptable behavior, make sure you mind your manners but also, don't take any guff from people trying to exploit the CoC in a manner that takes advantage the whole "microaggressions" fad that denigrates the needs of people who have real social issues they need help with for some off-the-wall behavior by people who can't handle being *responsible mature adults*. Even this word of warning could be considered problematic. I tried hard not to make it so, but I imagine someone will still be upset about it.
  >
  > Regardless, these are my notes. I'm sharing them, and trying to be ask kind and open as possible. Let's not ruin this class by making a scene.
  >
  > As Ellen DeGeneres says: **"Be kind to one another!"**
  >
  > Avoid drama and watch out for snakes! :snake:
