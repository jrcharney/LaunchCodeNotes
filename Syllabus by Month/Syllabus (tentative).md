# Syllabus (tentative)

> :warning: **WARNING!** The contents of this file are likely to change as the course continues.  I'd use this to help me keep track of my progress.

> :reminder_ribbon: **TODO** Include a table posing as a calendar in each section and links to each chapter covered in the class.

> :reminder_ribbon: **TODO**: Provide links to better syncronize documents with each other and to keep class lessons aligned with the class schedule.

## Syllabus by Month

This thing got too long for one document. So I broke it down into smaller ones.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="2020.01.md">January</a>❄</li>
                <li><a href="2020.02.md">February</a>💜</li>
                <li><a href="2020.03.md">March</a>☘</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
        <td>
