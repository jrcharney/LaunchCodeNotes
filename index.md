# Launch Code Notes

(written by Jason Charney (jrcharneyATgmailDOTcom)

These are my notes for the Launch Code LC101 class for the Spring 2020 course starting in January through June.

These notes will be updated regularly during this course and will be archived for future use.

I’ve added my own notes from my own experiences.

I’m mainly taking this class because I’ve no experience (as of January 2020) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) or [Angular](https://angular.io/), which this course covers along with JavaScript.

The first half f this course (Starting in January) will be working with [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

The second half of this course (Sometime in April) will be delving in to [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) using [Spring.io](https://spring.io/).

## Syllabus

> :warning: **WARNING!** The contents of this file are likely to change as the course continues.  I'd use this to help me keep track of my progress.

> :reminder_ribbon: **TODO** Include a table posing as a calendar in each section and links to each chapter covered in the class.

> :reminder_ribbon: **TODO**: Provide links to better syncronize documents with each other and to keep class lessons aligned with the class schedule.

This thing got too long for one document. So I broke it down by month into smaller ones.

## Note

These notes were originally composed in [Typora](https://www.typora.io/), and contain diagrams generated by [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/) and LaTeX notation which hopefully [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) is processing.  If there is anything broken, [submit an issue](https://github.com/jrcharney/LaunchCodeNotes/issues) and let me know about it.
