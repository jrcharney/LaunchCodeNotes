## JavaScript Style Guide

### 1. `camelCaseVariableNames`  

Camel Case is defined as starting with a lower case word, then using Uppercase for the first letter of any additional words in the variable name. ‚Äã

```js
const AstronautCount = 7;		// ‚ùå(Classes and interfaces start with uppercase )
const fuel_temp_celsius = -225;	// ‚ùå (Constants should be ALL caps if separated by underscores)
let is_ready = false;			// ‚ùå
const astronautCount = 7;		// ‚úÖ (actually this is wrong b/c it is a const. var should be used here.)
const fuleTempCelsius = -225;	// ‚úÖ (actually this is also wrong b/c it is a const. var should be used here.)
let isReady = false;		    // ‚úÖ
```

> :scream: **OH NO!** Their "good" and "bad" examples are WRONG! You can use underscores in constant variables, but `CONSTANTS_SHOULD_BE_ALL_CAPS`. In fact the `const` keyword is being way too casually. You should use `var` for your variable declarations, `let` for variables you are using in iteration loops, and `const` for actual constants. 
>
> Also, AVOID using `const` in the Node.js console as constants **cannot** be reassigned if you make a mistake.

### 2. Descriptive Variable Names

Variable names should convey meaning. Don't be afraid to describe your variables!

```js
const c = 7;					// ‚ùå
const fuleTempC = -225; 		// ‚ùå
let ir = false; 				// ‚ùå
const astronautCount = 7;		// ‚úÖ
const fuelTempCelsius = -225;	// ‚úÖ
let isReady = false;			// ‚úÖ
```

### 3. Put Opening Braces and Statments on the Same Line

> :information_source: **NOTE**: There really is nothing wrong with puting your opening brace or statement on the next line, but it's probably a good idea to put them on the same line for style purposes.

Put opening braces on the same line as the statement.

```js
if(fuelTempCelsius > -220)
    {							// ‚ùå (OTOH, here's a good reason to put them on the same line)
        console.log('WARNING');
    }							// ‚ùå
else
    {							// ‚ùå
        console.log('Temp fine');
    }							// ‚ùå

// In the above example, the parser automatically indented on the next line.
// While that code does work, it's an eyesore to look at.

if(fuelTempCelsius > -220){		// ‚úÖ (Much better)
    console.log('WARNING');
} else {						// ‚úÖ
    console.log('Temp fine');
}								// ‚úÖ
```

### 4. Always Use Braces for `if` Statements and Loops

> :nerd_face: **ACTUALLY...** if you only have ONE line following an `if` statement or loop, it's OK. So, the "bad" example is really not so bad. There should be a better "bad" example to show.
>
> :reminder_ribbon: **TODO**: Write a better "bad" example to show when using braces are necessary for grouping more than one line following a conditional statement or loop.

```js
if (fuelTempCelsius > -220)
    console.log('WARNING');			// "‚ùå" (Acutally, this is fine.)

for(let i = 0; i < 100; i++)		// "‚ùå" (Acutally, this is fine.)
    console.log(i);

if (fuelTempCelsius > -220){		// ‚úÖ
    console.log('WARNING');
}

for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++){		// ‚úÖ
    console.log(i);
}
```

### 5. Use Semicolons

> :question: "Why are Semicolons actually used?"
>
> In languages like C, C++, and Java, every line ends with a semicolon.  JavaScript follows the same convention, however it is not strictly enforced like it should be.  Nevertheless, you SHOULD use semicolons even if some coders don't.
>
> TBH: Semicolons are actually why I like JavaScript way more than Python.
>
> Also, you can put two separate lines on the same line with a semicolon, which is how the `for` loop works.
>
> :reminder_ribbon: **TODO**: Write a better example fo why it is necessary to use semicolons. The examples that are considered "bad" will still work because they are self-contained.

```js
let fuelTempCelsius = -200	// "‚ùå" (Actually, It will still work because it's on its own line.)
if (fieldTempCelsius > -220){
    console.log('warning')	// "‚ùå" (Acutally, It will still work for the same reason as the previous example. Also there's braces that should help contain it.)
}

let fuelTempCelsius = -200;		// ‚úÖ
if (fieldTempCelsius > -220){
    console.log('warning');		// ‚úÖ 
}

```

### 6. Indent Code Block One Tab

OK, now THIS is an actual rule.

Indentation is a key tool for making code readable. Indent one `Tab` inside each **code block**. The defintion of what a `Tab` is differes between groups. The important thing is to be consistent and use the same `Tab` throughout your project.

> :information_source: **NOTE**: A `Tab` in most circles is considered to be defined as equivalent to four spaces. YMMV.

```js
// üò± The horror! The horror!
const drivingLogKm = [120, 34, 15, 71, 89, 94];
let totalKm = 0;
for (let i=0; i < drivingLogKm.length; i++) {
totalKm = totalKm + drivingLogKm[i];		// ‚ùå
console.log("Adding", drivingLogKm[i]);		// ‚ùå
console.log("Total Kilometers", totalKm);		// ‚ùå
if (drivingLogKm[i] > 100) {		// ‚ùå
console.log("warning: trip distance longer than advised") 		// ‚ùå‚ùå
}		// ‚ùå
}
if (totalKm > 1000) {
console.log("Over limit for month");			// ‚ùå
} else {
console.log("Still under limit for month");		// ‚ùå
}

// üòå This is much better
const drivingLogKm = [120, 34, 15, 71, 89, 94];
let totalKm = 0;
for (let i=0; i < drivingLogKm.length; i++) {
    totalKm = totalKm + drivingLogKm[i];		// ‚úÖ
    console.log("Adding", drivingLogKm[i]);		// ‚úÖ
    console.log("Total Kilometers", totalKm);		// ‚úÖ
    if (drivingLogKm[i] > 100) {		// ‚úÖ
        console.log("warning: trip distance longer than advised")	// Hey!, Waitaminute! No semi-colon! "‚ùå"
    }		// ‚úÖ
}
if (totalKm > 1000) {
    console.log("Over limit for month"); 		// ‚úÖ
} else {
    console.log("Still under limit for month");		// ‚úÖ
}
```
