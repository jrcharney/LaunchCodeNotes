# 13. Modules

> :information_source: **NOTE:** We start working on Node.js stuff here!

## 13.1. What are Modules?

Just like functions should be kept small and accomplish only one thing, we want to apply the same idea for the different parts of our program. **Modules** allow us to keep the features of our programs in separate, smaller peices. We code these smaller chunks and then connect the modules together to create the big project.

Modules are like Legos. Each peice has its own distinct shape and function, and the same set of pieces can bec combined in lots of different wayt to create uniqu results.

### 13.1.1. One Possible Scenario

Imagine we wanted to create a program that quizzes students on their JavaScript skills.

What would go in this app? Features could include:

1. Selecting questions from a stored array or boect.
2. Presenting the questions to the students and collecting the answers.
3. Scoring the quizzes.
4. Storing the results.

This would be a useful app, but we could make it better by adding some other features. Instead of just quizzing students, maybe we could add some tutorial pages. Our app now porvides some teaching and assessment content.

Next, how about adding some non-graded practice to make sure the students are ready for their final quiz? Once we accomplish that, we could continue adding to our app to make it better and better.

Let's pause for a momemnt to consider what happens to the size of our project. As the program evolves from the straightforward quiz app to one that includes tutorials and practice tasks, the number of lines of code increaded. Now imagine we replicate all of these features for two or three other programming languages.

It would probably look something like this.

```mermaid
graph TB
	parent("JavaScript Skills Tracker")
	tut["Tutorials"]
	prac["Practice"]
	quiz["Quizzes"]
	res["Store Results"]
	topics("Topics")
	score("Select & score questions")
	parent --> tut
	parent --> prac
	parent --> quiz
	parent --> res
	tut --> topics
	prac --> topics
	quiz --> score
```

The result is a mammoth program tht contains **thousands of lines of code** (measured in **KLOC**). How would this impact debugging? How about keeping the code DRY 🌵?  Do any of the features overlap? How easy is it to add new features?

### 13.1.2. Why Use Modules

Modules help us keep our project origanized. If we find a bug in the quiz part of our program, then we can focus our attention on the quiz module rather than the entire codebase.

Modules also save us effor in other projects--another example of the DRY 🌵 concept. We have already practiced condensing repetitive tasks into loops or functions. Similarly, if we design our quiz module in a generic way, then we can use the same module in other programs.

Even better, we can SHARE our modules with other programmers and use someone else's work (with permission) to enhance our own. Writing the imaginary quiz/tutorial practice app from scratch would take us many, many weeks. However, someone in the coding community might already have modules that we can immediately incorporate into our own project--saving us time and effort.

> ***Modules keep us from reinventing the wheel.***

Some modules also provide us with useful shortcuts. `readline-sync` allowed us to collect input from a user, and this module contains a lot of other methods besides the `.question` we used in our examples. Rather than making every developer write their own code for interacting with the user through the console, `readline-sync` makes the process easier for all by providing a set of ready-to-use functions. We do not need to worry about *how* the modules work. We just need to be able to pull it into our projects and use its functions.

## 13.2. `require` Modules

In order to take advantage of modules, we must *import* them with the **`require`** command. You've seen this before with `readline-sync`.

```js
const input = require('readline-sync');

let name = input.question("What is your name?");
console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
```

LIne 1 imports the `readline-sync` module and assigns its functions to the input variable.

==Modules are either *single functions* or *objects that contain multiple functions*. If importing a module returns a single function, we use the variable name to call that function. If the module returns an object, we use dot notation to call the function sotred in the object.== In line 3, we see an example of this. `input.question` calls the `question` function stored in the `readline-sync` module.

Later, we will see examples of importing and using single function modules.

> **Example**: Let's check the type of `input` after we import the `readline-sync` module.
>
> ```js
> const input = require('readlin-sync');
> 
> console.log(typeof input);
> ```
>
> ```
> object
> ```

The `readline-sync` module contains several key-value pairs, each of which matches a key (e.g. `question`) with a specific function.

### 13.2.1. Where Do We Find Modules?

Modules come from three places:

1. A local file on your computer.
2. Node itself, known as **core modules** ([Link](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/docs/api/) or [Link](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/ref_modules.asp))
3. An external registry such as [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

### 13.2.2. How Does Node Know Where to Look?

The string value passed into `require` tells Node where to look for a module.

#### 13.2.2.1. User Created Modules

If a module is stored on your computer the string passed into `require` must provide a **path** and a **filename**. This path tells Node where to find the module, and it describes how to move up and down within the folders on your computer. Paths can be extremely detailed but best practice recommends that you keep local modules either in the same folder as your project or only one level from your project. Simple paths are better.

A **relative path** starts with `./` or `../`.

* `./` tells Node to search fomodules in the current project folder, commonly called the **current working directory**.
* `../` tells Node to search for the moduels in folder one level up, also know as the **parent directory**.

Following best practices gives us three scenarios for importing one file into another:

1. **The module is in the current working directory**: If we want to import `hello.js` into `index.js`, we add `const hello = require('./hello.js');` on line 1 of `index.js`.
2. **The module is in the parent directory**: If we want to import `hello.js` from  a directory that is one level up into `myCoolApp.js`, then we add `const hello = require('../hello.js');` on line 1 of `myCoolApp.js`
3. **The module is a child directory**: A **child directory**. or **sub-directory**, is a directory is in the current directory. If we want ot import `myCoolApp.js` in the child directory `Projects`, into `index.js`, then we add `const coolApp = require('./Projects/myCoolApp.js');` on line 1 of `index.js`.

### 13.2.2.2. Other Modules

If the filename passes to `require` does not start with `./` or `../`, the Node checkes two resources for the moduel requested.

* Node looks for a Core module with a matching name.
* Node looks for a module installed from an external source like NPM.

Core modules are installed in a Node itself, and as such do not require a path description. These modules are *local*, but Node knows where to find them. [Core modules](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/ref_modules.asp) take precedence over ANY other moddules with the same name.

If Node does not find the requested module after checking Core, it looks to the [NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/), which contains hundreds of thousands of free code packages for developers.

### 13.2.3. `packages.json` File

Node keeps track of all the modules you import into your project. The list of modules is stored inside a **`package.json`** file.  For example, if we only import `readline-sync`, the file looks something like this:

```json
{
    "main": "index.js",
    "dependencies": {
        "readline-sync" : "1.4.9"
    }
}
```

> :information_source: **NOTE**: YOu may have seen `package.json` yet, because repl.it hides this file by default. We'll talk more about this later.

>
> :exclamation: **Answer**: d.

## 13.3. NPM

**Node Package Manager** (**NPM**) is a tool for finding and installing Node modles. NPM has two major parts.

1. A registry of modles.
2. Command line tools for installing modules

### 13.3.1. NPM Registry

The NPM registry a listing of thousands of modules that are stored on a remote server. These can be `require`d  and downloaded to your project. The module has been contributed by other developers just like you.

There's an [online version of the registry](https://www.npmjs.com/) where you can search for a module by desired functionality.

Here's what happens when we search for `readline-sync` on NPM. ([Link](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=readline-sync) to try it yourself!)

![npm readline-sync](./../../Images/npm-readline-sync.png)

An exact match appear as the first result. That is the `readline-sync` module we require. Clicking on the first result leads to the NPM page that describes the `readline-sync` module.

On the details page, you will see:

1. Usage statsitics (how often the module is used)
2. Instructions on how to tuse the modules (example code)
3. Version information
4. The author(s)
5. Sourcecode repository (also known as a "repo")

![npm readline-sync](./../../Images/npm-readline-sync-page.png)

### 13.3.2. NPM Command Line Interface (CLI) ​​

The NPM **comand line interface** (**CLI**) is installed with Node. The NPM CLI is used in a computer's *terminal* to install modules into a Node project.  If you don't know what any of that is, you'll find out in a later chapter.

But just to give you a preview, here's what it looks like when I run it on my terminal. (Note: I added some features to my terminal that make it look different. You're may look different.) (By the way, if you run this, you cna exit the program by typing `.exit` (with the period in front of it!))

![image-20200217184928686](./../../Images/terminal-npm-cli.png)

For now, recall that we coded many Node projects inside of repl.it, which allows us to simulate a development environment WITHOUT having to install any software on our computers. As such, repl.it automatically handles much of the work installing external modules.

> :computer: **You probably should have installed node already.**
>
> Seriously, you can use Node locally as a local repl to try out stuff, sort of like how you would use a calculator to check math. That's what I've been doing.
