## 22.1. What is Git?

### 22.1.1. Version Control Systems

==A **version control system** (VCS) is a systme for tracking changes to a code pbase and storing each version.== VCSs assist programmers with keeping backups and a history of the revisions made to the code base over time. With that history, programmers can rollback to a version without a particular bug. A VCS also enables collaboration between programmers as they can work on different versions of a code base and share their work.

Git is one VCS and is one VCS and is prevalent amongst programmers and corporations.

==A VCS has a **repository** (or **repo** for short) which is a storage container for the code base.== Repos include files within the code base, the versions over time and a log of the changes made. When a programmer updates the repo, it means they are making a **commit**.

### 22.1.2. Getting Started with Git

In order ot get started with Git, you need to install Git on you machine and install Visual Studio Code.

> :information_source: **NOTE**: I spent a good part of a weekend editing the instructions on [Assigment #4](../B.%20Assignments/A4.HTML%20Me%20Something.md) on how to do this. Go look at that for instructions.

## 22.2. Repositories and Commits

### 22.2.1. Create a Repository

To get started with a git repo, the programmer (you) must firs create one. To create a git repository, the programmer navigates to their project directory and uses the command `git init`, like so:

```bash
$ pwd
/Users/student/
$ mkdir homework
$ cd homework
$ git init
	Initializing empty Git repository in /Users/student/homework/.git/
```

The programmer is ready to code away!

### 22.2.2. Making Commits

After a while, the programmer has made a lot of changes and saved their code files many times over. So when they do make a commit to their repo?

==*The general rule of thumb is that any time a significant change in functionality is made, a commit should be made.*==

If the programmer has created the Git repo and is ready to commit, they can do so by following the commit process.

> :information_source: **NOTE**: Git does not have a simple commit command, however, making a proper commit requires that the programmers follow a longer procedure than just one command.

The procedure for making a commit to a Git repo includes 4 stages:

1. `git status` give the programmer information about files that have been changed.
2. `git add` allow the programmer to add specific or all changed files to a commit.
   * `git rm` allows a programer to remove a specific file from a commit. These two commands are part of the *staging* process.
3. `git commit` creates the new commit with the files that the programmer added.
4. `git log` display a log of every commit in the repo.

If the steps above are followed correctly, the programmer will find their latest commit at the top of the log.

Here's how the process will look in the terminal:

```bash
Students-Computer:homework student$ git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        learning-git.js

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
Students-Computer:homework student$ git add .
Students-Computer:homework student$ git commit -m "My first commit"
 [master (root-commit) 2c1e0af] My first commit
  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
  create mode 100644 learning-git.js
Students-Computer:homework student$ git log
commit 2c1e0af9467217d76c7e3c48bcf9389ceaa4714b
Author: Student <lc101.student@email.com>
Date:  Wed Apr 24 14:44:59 2019 -0500

    My first commit
```

To break down what happns in a commit even further:

When using `git status`, the output shows two categories:

* **Modified tracked files** (`M`) - The files exist in the Git repo already, but is different from the version in the repo.
* **Modified untracked files** (`U`) - The file is a new file that is not currently tracked in the repository.

`git add` adds files to the commit, but does not commit those file. By using `git add .` (with a period), all the modified files are added to the commit. If a programmer only wants to add one modified file, they can do so.

`git commit` acutally commits the files that were added to the repo. By adding `-m "My first commit"`, a comment was added to the commit. This is helpful for looking through the log and seeing detailed comments on the changed made in each commit.

`git log` shows the author of the commit, the date made, the comment, and a 40-character hash. This *hash* is a value that is a key for Git to refer to the version. Programmers rarely use these hashes unless they want to roll back to that version.

## 22.3. Remote Repositories

### 22.3.1. Local, Remote, Github, Oh My!

So far, we've covered how to set up a Git repo on the local machine. But one of the benefits of using a VCS was storage fo backups. So what happens to the code base if something happens to the machine? That is where remote respositories come in. Instead of keeping a Git repo only on a local machine, the code base is a **remote repository** and the programmers keep working on it keep copies on their local machine.

To get started with remote repos, create an account on [Github](https://www.github.com/). From there, programmers can create a remote repo, view commit history, and report issues with the code.

### 22.3.2. Collaborating with Colleagues

What if a programmer wants to start collaborating with their colleages on a new project? They might need to start with the work that one of their colleagues has already done. In this particular case, the programmer has to import the work that is being stored in an online repo on to their local machine.

They can clone a remote repo by using the `git clone <url>` command
