## 21.1. What is CSS?

I saw this image on Twitter and though this describes the relationship between HTML and CSS with perfect simplicity.

### 21.1.1. Background

As discussed in the previous chapter, HTML lays out the structure of a document. With HTML attributes, programmers can add some specification to tags. Yet when programmers make pages with only HTML, the web page looks rather bland. When making a website, the structure of the page is important, as is how those elements appear.

While HTML creates the structures and content of the page, CSS adds the styles to make it beautiful!

==**Cascading Style Sheet**== (not sure why the author calls it "Cascading Styling Sheets", that is wrong!) ==(**CSS**) is a style sheet language that allows programmers to add styling to web documents. With CSS, programmers can change backgrounds and fonts, the sys of different elements, and many more things.

CSS works by applying stylesheet rules to different elements. A style rule could be "Make this lettering purple" (`.purple{color: #808;}`) or "Make this font Helvetica" (`.hellsyeah{font-family: Helvetica;}`). CSS is a *cascading* style sheet language because the style rules apply based on a specified preference. To the rules "cascade".

### 21.1.2. Check Your Understanding :white_check_mark:

## 21.2. CSS Structure

### 21.2.1. Writing CSS

#### 21.2.1.1. CSS Selectors

#### 21.2.1.2. Declaration Blocks

#### 21.2.1.3. CSS Examples

### 21.2.2. Linking CSS to HTML

#### 21.2.2.1. Order of Precedence

Because there is an order of precedence to the location of CSS, it is important to be able to add ro change CSS in all three locations. Programmers use this to their advantage if they want to be very specific with overwritng some CSS for one element. ==Inline CSS is highest in precedence with internal CSS being next and then external CSS as lowest.==

### 21.2.3. Check Your Understanding :white_check_mark:

> :question: **Question**: What is the order of precidedence in CSS?
> a. Internal > External > Inline
> b.  Inline > Internal > External
> c.  Inline > External > Internal
> d. External > Internal > Inline

> :exclamation: **Answer**: b.

## 21.4. Exercise: CSS :runner:

> :reminder_ribbon: **TODO**: Defintely add the exercise for this chappter.



> :nerd_face: **Personal Experience**: CSS is very important to know especially with [DOM](23.DOM%20and%20Events.md) functions like [`querySelect()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelector) and [`querySelectAll()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelectorAll) to select objects based on CSS, or tools like [Emmit](https://emmet.io/) which can quickly generate HTML from CSS style syntax. This can also be useful if you use [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) in the terminal to retrieve data from a JSON file.

:checkered_flag: One step closer to the end! (That sounds kind of morbid.) **On to the next big thing: [Git](22.Git.md)**
