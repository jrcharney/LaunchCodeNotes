## 24.1. How the Internet Works

> *"The Internet is not a big truck! It's a [series of tubes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtOoQFa5ug8)!"*

> --Ted Stevens (1923-2010)

Most people use the Internet without fully understanding how it works. Without much trouble, they can open a browser, navigate to a site, and interact with it. They do not need to know precisely *how* the Internet works ino rder to use it.

For web developers, howerver, fundamental understanding of the flow of information across the internet is essential.

### 24.1.1. Servers and Clients

The Internet uses the **client-server model**. A **server** is an application that provides resources---such as raw data, web pages, or images. A **client** is an application that requests resources from a server.

> **Note**: Yes I know, Cisco Geeks, I don't have my connections set up for these devices in Packet Tracer. But I needed a quick diagram.

When navigating the web, the client is the web browser on your computer or smartphone. When you click on a line or type in an address and hit *Enter*, the client/browser makes a request to the server that sits in a building somewhere out in the world. The server receives the request, and sends a response back to the client. The client then displays the content of the response.

> **Fun Fact**: In the client-server modle, the server may sometimes be on the *same* computer as the client. This is often the case when a programmer is building a web application. The in-progress, development version of the application is on their laptop, as is their browser that they use to test the app.

### 24.1.2. Protocols

A **protocol** is a standard for communcation between computers. Mosts web communication uses *three* protocols, in fact.

> :nerd_face: **Actually...** It's more complex that that. (Insert a who bunch of stuff from Cisco here.) (Not really, but just saying.

We will go over three of the more frequent protocols in this section, but a thorough understanding of each protocol is well beyond the scope of this class. However, as a web developer, it is important that you have a general understanding of their role. Each protocol has a different and critical job in enabling web communication.

**Common Web Protocols**

| Protocol                                                     | Role                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Hypertext Transfer Protocol** (HTTP)                       | High-level web communication for transfering files and information, including:<br />* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files<br />* Images and other media<br />* Form submissions |
| **Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol** (TCP/IP) | Low-level web communication for transferring small chuncks of raw data known as *packets*. |
| **Domain Name Service** (DNS)                                | Translate human-friendly names into Server IP Addresses.     |



#### 24.1.2.1. HTTP

**Hypertext Transfer Protocol** (**HTTP**) is the most important protocol for web developers to understand, which you may have guessed from the title fo this chaper. It specifies how request for common web data---such as HTML files or images---should be structured, as well as responses to such request. The details of request and response message structures are the topic of the rest of this chapter.

==**HTTPS** referes to the HTTP protocol used with a secure connection.== A secure connection encrypts so that it can't be read while in-transit. The data is encrypted by the server/client before being transmitted, and decrypted once it is received by the client/server. The precise details of how such encryption works is beyond the scope of this corse.

#### 24.1.2.2. TCP/IP

> **The OSI Model** or Open System Interconnection Model, defines a networking framework to implement prototocols in seven layers. The Internet Protocol Suite groups this model into four groups.

> ```
> 7. Application Layer
> 6. Presentation Layer
> 5. Session Layer
> 4. Transport Layer
> 3. Network Layer
> 2. Data Link Layer
> 1. Physical Layer
