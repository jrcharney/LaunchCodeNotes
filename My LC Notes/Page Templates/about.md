# About Page Templates

This directory is used as a place to store page templates.

## Common Pages

* index_template.md - A page to represent the other pages in the directory.



## TODO

* [ ] Should I reupload my notes as a GitHub compatible Jekyll site?
* [ ] Replace spaces in file names with underscores. (It's such a pain to insert `%20` where there is a space)
