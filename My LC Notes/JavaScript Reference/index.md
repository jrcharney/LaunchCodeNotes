# JavaScript Reference

> :construction: **UNDER CONSTRUCTION** This page is a work in progress and should be thought of more of a placeholder for something to work on later.

## Introduction

This JavaScript Reference is my interpretation on things like what is on MDN, W3Schools, and other resources.

Each page represents a class, type of object, in JavaScript. This reference will divide the classes up in to the Classic Types (which include the primitive data types), and the New Types (often stuff added as of ES6 onward.)

Classic types are fundamental and if you are taking LC101, you should know them.

New types are secondary. If you are building a web app or want to learn something new, give these types a try. Just make sure that they work on as many platforms as possible.
