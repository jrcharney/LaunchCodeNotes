# About This Directory

This directory contains a lot of useful information that will be useful. Initially it was stuff that I added to the outline but because it it so frequented, I've decided to move some of this information to their own files.

## What is Computer Science?

**Computer Science** or **Data Science** in some places, is not the science of computers, but the science of how data is processed.  Computer Science is a subgenre of mathematics. There is a lot of abstract ideas and though processes you must develop to understand it.

Typora has given me the ability to express these concepts in Markdown, Latex, and Mermaid. I only wish I had this back in college.

You may have seen the movie *The Imitation Game* where Benedict Cumberbatch plays Alan Turing. While Turing is consider to be the father of computer science, and an icon in the LGBTQ community, there were many others who preceded and followed him who have made great strides in making computers the way thy are today.
