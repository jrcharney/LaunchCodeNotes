# Launch Code LC101 Notes

(written by Jason Charney (jrcharneyATgmailDOTcom)

These are my notes for the Launch Code LC101 class for the Spring 2020 course starting in January.

These notes will be updated regularly during this course and will be archived for future use.

I've added my own notes from my own experiences.

I'm mainly taking this class because I've no experience (as of January 2020) with TypeScript or Angular, which this course covers along with JavaScript.

**These notes are best viewed with [Typora](https://www.typora.io/)**. Typora provides LaTeX support with [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) and diagram support using [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/), both will be useful to use throughout my note taking and this course.
