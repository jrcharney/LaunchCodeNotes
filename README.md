# Launch Code LC101 Notes

(written by Jason Charney (jrcharneyATgmailDOTcom)

These are my notes for the Launch Code LC101 class for the Spring 2020 course starting in January through June.

These notes will be updated regularly during this course and will be archived for future use.

I've added my own notes from my own experiences.

I'm mainly taking this class because I've no experience (as of January 2020) with TypeScript or Angular, which this course covers along with JavaScript.

## About Me

**My name is Jason Charney.** I'm a graduate of Maryville University's class of 2007. I have a Bachlors of Science in Computer Science from Maryville. I've been fiddling with computers on and off again for most of my life. I got started fiddling with HTML in 1997 in high school, but it didn't take off until I established my own website in 2003 just for fun.  I'm an Eagle Scout. A high functioning autistic who tries to advocate for people with disabilities. And a staunch supporter of public transportation.

I may seem like this intimidating "genius" at JavaScript, but I am by no means a "genius". Calling somebody a genius is subjective. There are a lot of people who are considered "smart" who do stupid things. Some travel the path of continuing to make those mistakes fearing there image would take a blow. But a true genius admits they are fallible, that they make mistakes, than even smart people still have a lot to learn.

## About These Notes

These notes include some content from  *Introduction to Professional Web Development in JavaScript* (which I will constantly refer to as the "LC Textbook") will include the questions from the "Check Your Understanding" sections which reappear in the concept check quizes.

Exercises, Studios, and Graded Assignments are not part of this repo. I will NOT post them. So don't ask.

Sometimes I'm ahead, sometimes I'm behind. I usally keep track of how I am doing as well as what assignments were posted to the class scheudle in the [Syllabus (tentative)](Syllabus%20by%20Month/Syllabus%20(tentative).md) file whenever the course instructor updates the schedule.

Learning is not a straight path! If you look at it like a straight straw to which are just going through the motions and don't contribute anything, you will miss out on a lot of stuff. Learning is more like a bendy straw with the loops and curls in it. If you are not having fun while doing it, you won't gain anything from it.

So experiment! Try stuff! Make mistakes! There's going to be a lot of trial and error. And it's a good idea to go to the study sessions outside of class, and make some friends, and work together--*OFFLINE*--so that you get the most from this expeirence.

## My Own Goals

I hope this course will get me motivated to start working on [my website](https://www.jrcharney.com/) again and will draw more employers to be interested in hiring me to work for them.

## Social Media

Social media is a good asset, but you can get lost or distracted along the way. So I would recommend either communicating on Slack or the Discord Server I'm developing (link coming soon).

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/jrcharney) seems popular among coders. (Lots of swearing, a little bit NSFW, but totally worth it).

A few people I recommend following

* [JavaScript Joel](https://twitter.com/joelnet).
* [Samantha Ming](https://twitter.com/samantha_ming).
* [Julia Evans](https://twitter.com/b0rk).
* [Jacob Paris](https://twitter.com/jacobmparis).
* [Carlos Caballero](https://twitter.com/Carlillo)
* [Pina Varnel](https://twitter.com/ADHD_Alien) who make the *ADHD Alien* comics.
* and [Java](https://twitter.com/java) (whose programming language kinda sucks but their Twitter feed makes it suck less.)

There's probably a list of other people. But these are the people who I like the most.

## Get Involved

Participate in [local tech events](https://www.sluug.org/resources/calendar/) like [Code Till Dawn](https://www.meetup.com/codetilldawn/) or find something on Meetup.

Use online coding tools like [Repl.it](https://repl.it/@jrcharney), [Codepen.io](https://codepen.io/jrcharney), and [Github](https://github.com/jrcharney/) to practice or share your skills.
